# Earthquake Emergency E-commerce
The Earthquake Emergency E-commerce app is designed to help individuals affected by the catastrophic earthquakes that occurred in Turkey and Syria on February 6th. The app allows users to purchase emergency packages for those who have been impacted by the earthquakes. By using this app, users can make a meaningful contribution to the relief efforts and support the affected communities. Everyone has the power to make a positive impact, and I hope [this app](https://earthquake-emergency.herokuapp.com/) will inspire individuals to come together and support those who need it most.
